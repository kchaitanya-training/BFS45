java process cycle
--------------------

sample java hello world program
-------------------------------
1) We have to start java program with class keyword.
2) each class have unieque class name
3) we have to declare methods to define logic


java sample code:

class FirstExample{

public static void main(String s[]){

}
}

Java execution
---------------

-> javac  command--Java compiler,it call the compiler and scan the java extension file
   if everthing is good then it will conver into .class file.
   
   java   -> runtime command , It read .class file(intermediate file) and convertes machine unterstand code and execute to give the output


java installation
------------------

JDK -- Java development kit (JRE, compiler)-- comiler and running code
JRE -- Java runtime environemnt  -- running code


  --> organization level--> DEV environment -> UAT -> PROD
  
  
  
classname -> have start with Capital letter ex : Hello
                                                 Transaction  
												 HelloWorld
												 TravelPayment
												 

methodname ->  has to start with small letters and secound word should               start	with capital letter



MyClass referce -->  using new keywork with class consturctor  can allow         to create the object  and using same class type of refernce ca           can access the object .
        
               The use of object is, allow to run the funcitons and access variables.



Constructor :  constructor define with classname and there is not return type for them. It help to run some logic whlile creating constructor.			   

Assessment : 
1)Create class name wiht your name and define two methods and run it.

2) create the diffet class with two method and try to comunicate one method to other and run it.

3) create class with constructor , methods and run it.
